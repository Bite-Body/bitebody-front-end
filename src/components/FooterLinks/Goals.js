              <h3>Weight Loss</h3>
              <br/>
              Food is broken down into fuel for the body by a process called metabolism. After weight loss, metabolism slows down and gets more efficient, requiring fewer calories to do its job. Hormonal signals can also change.

The brain increases the hunger hormone called ghrelin, which tries to get you to eat more calories. And, the hormones that tell the brain it's time to stop eating, the “feeling full” signals, decrease. These are just some of the factors that make weight regain so common. Weight management is a constant tug-of-war inside the body.

                    <br/><br/>
              <h3>Weight Gain</h3>
              
              This is where most people do things wrong and that’s why bulking is usually associated with getting fat and so many guys and gals are afraid to eat more – because they are afraid they will get fat. As I said, this is partially true – if your caloric surplus is too large you will put on more fat than muscle. But if you do it smart the results will be impressive.

              The sweet spot for a lean bulk is to gain no more than 0.5-1 pound of body weight each week. For most people this will be split 50/50 between muscle and fat gain. So, basically you will gain 1 pound of fat for each pound of muscle – which is a good ratio.

              All you have to do now is to set your caloric surplus so that you stay within the 0.5-1 pound weight gain range each week. If you are a beginner you will build muscle faster so you should be more towards the 1 pound per week rate, if you are more advanced you should probably more towards the 0.5 pound per week rate.

                  <h3>Building Muscle</h3>  
                  Are you trying to get stronger? We can help with that. Are you in it for the less tangible health benefits, like stronger bones and an increased lifespan? Maybe you just want to a new hobby, since everyone seems like they're spending more time and attention focused on exercise and showing their #gainz on social media.

For some guys, the answer to the exercise question will always be that they're looking to put on muscle. Whether you have a very specific goal, like getting into figure contests and bodybuilding, or you just want to fill out a t-shirt, you have to start somewhere, even if you've always struggled to add and keep weight onto a skinny frame in the past.
